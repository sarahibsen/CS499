== Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement a software solution for users to input data, select statistical operations to perform on the data, and visualize the results using different types of graphs. The application will cater to both novice and advanced users by providing an easy-to-use interface with flexibility for more complex statistical operations.

== Risks, Issues, and Opportunities 


[cols = "1,1,1"]
|===
|*Risk Title*	|	*Risk Score*	|	*Mitigation*
| Team member drop | 5 | Preload Tasks
| Legacy Systems | 3 | Ensure libraries are up to date/when was the last version updated
| Library chosen won't work the way we want it to. | 6 | Have back up libraries
|Plagiarism or copyright infringement | 5 | Ensure that team members do not inadvertently include code that is not original or is protected by copyright.
|Cross-Platform Incompatibilities| 8 | Test the application thoroughly on all platforms to ensure compatibility
| Incompatible Statistical Calculations | 8 | Implement robust input validation, error handling, and data cleaning to catch issues like unexpected delimiters or characters
|Incorrect Statistical Calculations| 8 | Implement a thorough testing process, using known data sets to verify that the statistical calculations are correct.
|Inadequate Graphing| 8 | Thoroughly test each type of graph with various data sets to ensure correct display and accurate representation of data.
|Difficult Code Expansion| 10 | Implement code reviews to ensure that new features are developed according to coding standards.
|Library not compatible with required Operating Systems| 6 | Read the pypi.org operating system section for each library and test on all required operating systems early.
